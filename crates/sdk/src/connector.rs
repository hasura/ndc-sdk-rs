/// Connectors using this library should implement this trait.
///
/// It provides methods which implement the standard endpoints defined by the
/// specification: capabilities, schema, query, mutation, query/explain,
/// and mutation/explain.
///
/// In addition, it introduces names for types to manage state and configuration
/// (if any), and provides any necessary context for observability purposes
/// (metrics, logging and tracing).
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// Connectors encapsulate data sources, and likely require configuration
/// (connection strings, web service tokens, etc.). The NDC specification does
/// not discuss this sort of configuration, because it is an implementation
/// detail of a specific connector, but it is useful to adopt a convention here
/// for simplified configuration management.
///
/// Configuration is specified by the connector implementation. It is provided
/// as a path to a directory. Parsing this directory should result in a
/// [`Connector::Configuration`].
///
/// ## State
///
/// In addition to configuration, this trait defines a [`Connector::State`] type
/// for state management.
///
/// State is distinguished from configuration in that it is not provided
/// directly by the user, and would not ordinarily be serializable. For example,
/// a connection string would be configuration, but a connection pool object
/// created from that connection string would be state.
